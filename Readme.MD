#Monitoring Data Transfomration Platform

This project aims to provide a generic platform for transforming any kind of monitoring data into performance Models.
We provide facilities to import transform monitoring data from Kieker and inspectIT into instances our generic Monitoring Data Model.
These can then be further transformed using the WESSBAS or iObserve approach.

The MDTP-Terminal project can be used to try out these features.
